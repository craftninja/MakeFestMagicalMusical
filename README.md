### Projects

Octosynth

1. Load the code onto an Arduino board
1. Connect wires for speaker
    * ground - uhhh... ground
    * Digital 11 - sound out
1. Connect wires for keys - power up the lil' prototype and figure out what lead connects to which key by touching the wires' bare ends
    * Digital ~6 and 7
    * Analog A0-A5
1. Cut the housing out with LAZERS
    * 1" keys - [file for 1/8 inch plywood](octosynth/design/redboardOneInchKeyPiano.ai)
    * teeny cardboard version - file for corrugated cardboard... pending design file
1. Use conductive adhesive copper tape to tape down the leads and act as "keys" on the piano
1. Put it all together and start an awesome band!!!
